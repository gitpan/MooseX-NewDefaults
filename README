NAME
    MooseX::NewDefaults - Alter attribute defaults with less pain

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.004 of MooseX::NewDefaults - released
    September 24, 2012 as part of MooseX-NewDefaults.

SYNOPSIS
        package One;
        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;

        has A => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 'say ahhh' });
        has B => (is => 'ro', default => sub { 'say whoo' });

        package Two;
        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;
        use MooseX::NewDefaults;

        extends 'One';

        # sugar for defining a new default
        default_for A => sub { 'say oooh' };

        # this is also legal
        default_for B => 'say oooh';

DESCRIPTION
    Ever start using a package from the CPAN, only to discover that it
    requires lots of subclassing and "has '+foo' => (default => ...)"? It's
    not recommended Moose best practice, and it's certainly not the
    prettiest thing ever, either.

    That's where we come in.

    This package introduces new sugar that you can use in your class,
    default_for (as seen above).

    e.g.

        has '+foo' => (default => sub { 'a b c' });

    ...is the same as:

        default_for foo => sub { 'a b c' };

NEW SUGAR
  default_for
    default_for() is a shortcut to extend an attribute to give it a new
    default; this default value may be any legal value for default options.

        # attribute bar defined elsewhere (e.g. superclass)
        default_for bar => 'new default';

    ... is the same as:

        has '+bar' => (default => 'new default');
